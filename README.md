#### Fonts

Considering the targeted audience, the sans serif type of font is the more appropriate because it is most often associated with simplicity and straightforwardness.

The website will use well known and popular font that are used online in order to bring to the user a "feeling of knowing".

* Poppins for headings.

* Lato for main content.

Sans serif will be use as a fall back if the fonts do not load. It is common as the main typographies are sans serif type.

#### Icons

* Some Font Awesome icons will be part of the website for better UX.
* The [favicon](static/images/favicon.ico) was created from [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/).
